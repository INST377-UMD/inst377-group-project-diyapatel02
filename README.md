# Holiday Planner

## Descriptipn
This project shows the different holidays in a given calendar year for a country selected by the user. 
This is because it is important for users know a country's holiday schedule before planning a vacation so they
know the availability for booking various aspects of their vacation. This is something important to consider because sometimes they
can book a trip to particular trip to a country not knowing that it is a holiday in that country which could lead to a
lot of goods and services being inaccessible during that period. Our preject mitigates that risk because it provides
a comprehensive list of holidays and the type of holiday in a given year based on the country the user selects. 

This project should be able to run on any given system as it is available to as many users as possible. For the best 
experience however, we recommend user a computer and running it on the broswer.
